# AI-Clone-of-ME
Are you really good with AI?

I'm looking for someone who can create an AI Chatbot clone of me.

Why?

I'm a teacher. But I don't want to keep repeating the same answers to the same questions.

I want to create a clone of me so that whenever someone asks my Chatbot questions, it can answer for me based on all of my writings.

Once the Chatbot is built, I can then develop an ai avatar of me.
-----------------
Creating an AI Chatbot clone based on your own writings is a fascinating project! To build an AI chatbot that mimics your writing style, you would need to train a model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, leveraging your past writings to help the model generate responses that sound like you. For this, you can use existing frameworks like GPT-3 or GPT-4, along with fine-tuning on your content to create more personalized responses.

Here's a step-by-step guide and Python code to create such a chatbot:
Step 1: Data Collection (Gather Your Writings)

To create a chatbot that mimics your writing style, you’ll need to collect all your writings, such as:

    Articles
    Blog posts
    Emails
    Lectures, notes, or transcripts of classes

The more diverse the content, the better the chatbot will be at answering different types of questions.
Step 2: Fine-Tuning GPT-3 or GPT-4 Model

You can fine-tune a model like GPT-3 or GPT-4 (provided by OpenAI) using your writings so that it learns your style and the way you answer questions.

Prerequisites:

    OpenAI API Key (for GPT-3/4)
    Python 3.7 or later
    Install necessary libraries

Step 3: Install Required Libraries

First, you'll need to install the necessary Python libraries:

pip install openai
pip install langchain
pip install openai-embeddings

Step 4: Prepare Data for Fine-Tuning

You’ll need to prepare your data in a format that can be used to fine-tune the GPT-3 model. For simplicity, let’s assume you’re going to format your writings into a question-answer format.

import openai

# Set up your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

# Fine-tune GPT-3 using your writings as examples
def fine_tune_model(training_data):
    response = openai.FineTune.create(
        training_file=training_data,  # Upload file containing your writings
        model="davinci"  # Base model for fine-tuning
    )
    return response

# Example training data
# Format your writings in a way like:
# [{"prompt": "How does quantum computing work?", "completion": "Quantum computing uses quantum bits (qubits)..."}]
training_data = "path_to_your_training_data.json"

# Fine-tune the model
fine_tune_model(training_data)

Step 5: Build a Chatbot with Fine-Tuned Model

After fine-tuning, you can use the fine-tuned model to interact with your chatbot. Below is the basic setup for your chatbot using the fine-tuned model.

import openai

# Set your API key
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

# Use the fine-tuned model for chat
def chatbot_query(message, model="davinci:ft-your-custom-model"):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine=model,  # Specify your fine-tuned model
        prompt=message,  # User query
        max_tokens=150,  # Limit the response length
        n=1,  # Number of responses to generate
        stop=None,  # Define stop sequences if needed
        temperature=0.7  # Controls randomness of output
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example conversation
message = "How can I effectively teach high school students about climate change?"
response = chatbot_query(message)
print("Chatbot Response: ", response)

Step 6: Adding an Avatar (Optional)

Once the chatbot is working and able to answer questions in your writing style, you can add a visual component like a 3D avatar of yourself.

For creating an avatar:

    Use a 3D avatar generator tool like Ready Player Me or Vroid Studio.
    Integrate the avatar into a web application or a platform that supports 3D visuals and real-time interaction with your AI model (you can use Unity or WebGL for web deployment).

Step 7: Deploying the Chatbot

Once your model is trained, you can deploy it using a web framework (such as Flask or Django) for easier interaction with students or anyone seeking answers.

Here’s a simple Flask app to expose the chatbot:

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import openai

openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    user_message = request.json.get('message')
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="davinci:ft-your-custom-model",  # Use your fine-tuned model
        prompt=user_message,
        max_tokens=150,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    return jsonify({"response": response.choices[0].text.strip()})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

Step 8: Fine-Tuning and Improving

    Feedback Loops: Collect data about how well the chatbot is performing and make adjustments to the model. If the model isn’t answering questions well, consider adding more relevant training data or adjusting the temperature setting.
    Continuous Learning: Once you have an established chatbot, you can allow it to continue learning based on ongoing conversations or questions that it may not have been able to answer correctly.

Final Notes

    Data Privacy: Ensure that the data you are using to train the model does not contain sensitive information.
    Accuracy: Keep monitoring and fine-tuning the chatbot to ensure its responses align with the tone and style you're aiming for.
    Scalability: If your chatbot becomes popular, consider using cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure to scale it.

By following the above steps, you will be able to create an AI chatbot that mimics your teaching style and can be used for answering questions in an automated fashion. Adding a virtual avatar will create an even more immersive and engaging experience for users.
